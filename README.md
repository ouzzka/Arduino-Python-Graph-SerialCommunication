# Arduino-Python-SerialComunication
This interface developed with pyqt5 allows to graph signals coming from the arduino's serial port in real time.
For this example 3 data from arduino are used.
More data can be added or just one.
In arduino the data must be sent as this way :
   Serial.print(Data1);
   Serial.print (","); 
   Serial.print(Data2);
   Serial.print(",");
   Serial.println(Data3);
